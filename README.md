The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

To acomplish this I created a logistic regression model that could succesfully predict whether a passenger would survive with a 79% accuracy score.
